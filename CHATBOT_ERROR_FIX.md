# üîß Chatbot Error Resolution Guide

## Error: "Chatflow not found in the database"

This error occurs when the F&Business website tries to connect to a Flowise chatflow that doesn't exist.

### ‚úÖ Immediate Solutions

#### Option 1: Use the Website Without AI (Recommended for now)
**What happened:** We've automatically disabled the chatbot to prevent errors.
**What works:** Everything else! Job search, categories, contact form, navigation.
**What you see:** A setup message in the AI section with instructions.

#### Option 2: Set Up Your Own AI Assistant (5-10 minutes)

1. **Install Flowise locally:**
   ```bash
   npx flowise start
   ```
   This opens Flowise at `http://localhost:3000`

2. **Create a new chatflow:**
   - Click "Create New Chatflow"
   - Add these nodes: Chat Memory ‚Üí Conversation Chain ‚Üí ChatOpenAI
   - Connect them and configure with your OpenAI API key
   - Save the chatflow

3. **Get your chatflow ID:**
   - After saving, copy the ID from the URL
   - Example: `abc123-def456-ghi789`

4. **Update the website:**
   
   **In `index.html` (around line 385):**
   ```javascript
   // Find this commented section and uncomment it:
   /*
   <script type="module">
       import Chatbot from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/flowise-embed/dist/web.js"
       Chatbot.init({
           chatflowid: "YOUR_CHATFLOW_ID_HERE", // ‚Üê Paste your ID here
           apiHost: "http://localhost:3000",    // ‚Üê Your Flowise URL
   ```

   **In `js/app.js` (around line 7):**
   ```javascript
   flowise: {
       chatflowId: 'YOUR_CHATFLOW_ID_HERE', // ‚Üê Same ID as above
       apiHost: 'http://localhost:3000',    // ‚Üê Same URL as above
       status: 'active'                     // ‚Üê Change from 'disabled'
   },
   ```

5. **Test it:**
   - Refresh your website
   - Click the chat button (bottom right)
   - You should see your AI assistant!

### üéØ What Each File Does

- **`index.html`** - Contains the Flowise embed script
- **`js/app.js`** - Contains chatbot configuration and error handling  
- **`css/styles.css`** - Styles for the setup message and chat interface

### üí° Pro Tips

1. **Test locally first:** Always test with `http://localhost:3000` before deploying
2. **Keep backups:** Save your chatflow configuration in Flowise
3. **Start simple:** Use a basic ChatGPT node first, add complexity later
4. **Check console:** Browser dev tools show detailed error messages

### üö® Still Having Issues?

The website is designed to work perfectly without the AI assistant. All core features remain functional:

- ‚úÖ Job search and filtering
- ‚úÖ Category browsing  
- ‚úÖ Contact form
- ‚úÖ Responsive design
- ‚úÖ Navigation and UI

The AI assistant is an enhancement, not a requirement!
